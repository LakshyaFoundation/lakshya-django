		<h3>Mission</h3>
		<p>Our mission is to enable NIT Warangal to efficiently develop an ecosystem of research and innovation while also making it accessible to all students.</p>
		<h3>Core Values</h3>
		<p>These are our guiding principles. Everytime we have a difficult decision to make, we come here.</p>	
		<ul> 
			<li><b>If we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear</b><br/>We want your support to nurture our work, while also seeing where exactly your contributions are being utilized. Being transparent, both in funds and activities, keeps us on the right track.</li><br/>
			<li><b>Everyone has something to contribute</b><br/>While the alumni contribute immensely with their experience, the system at NIT Warangal is built around students and faculty and is run by the administration. Coming together is not a way, but the only way to form a holistic sustainable approach to achieve our shared vision of a better NIT Warangal.</li><br/>
			<li><b>There is a lot that technology can offer</b><br/>At the heart of our effort is making a point - technology can solve problems, create wealth and make life easier. Institutions like NIT Warangal need to breed technology, become hotbeds for cutting edge research and innovation. We do not use technology to assist us, technolgy forms the core of our work.</li><br/>
