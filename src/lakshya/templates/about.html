		<h3 class="cB">Vision</h3>
		<p>Our vision is to develop the Indian higher education system to stand alongside the best educational institutions in the world.</p>		
		<h3>Mission</h3>
		<p>Our mission is to enable NIT Warangal to efficiently develop an ecosystem of research and innovation while also making it accessible to all students.</p>	
		<h3>Core Values</h3>
		<p>Before we began our work, we prepared a list of values to guide us. Everytime we have a difficult decision to make, we visit this list.</p>	
		<ul>
			<li><b>Transparency</b><br/>Every donation made is like watering a plant and no one waters a plant they are not allowed to see. We want your support to nurture our work, while also seeing where exactly your contributions are being utilized. Being transparent, both in funds and activities, keeps us on the right track - if we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear.</li><br/>
			<li><b>Sustainability</b><br/>We are in this for the long-haul. We work to have a lasting impact that will take us closer to our vision. As they say - give a man a fish and you feed him for a day, teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.</li><br/>
			<li><b>Synergy</b><br/>We started with a small team, but it was a team in every sense of the word. Students, faculty and alumni, all brought something unique to the table. Each group is capable of great things, as a team we can achieve the impossible.</li><br/>
