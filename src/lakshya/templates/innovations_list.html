				<p>Self Compacting Concrete using recycled aggregate is a research project to test usage of concrete from demolished structures to produce new concrete. As opposed to the current industry which uses such 'recycled aggregate' for pavemanet blocks and tiles, this research aims at producing concrete capable of bearing heavy loads.</p>

				<p>As Concrete is brittle under tensile loading, its mechanical properties may be improved by randomly oriented short discrete fibres. Ductility of concrete is improved with fibre reinforced cementitious composites. To provide additional confinement to concrete, Ferrocement shell can be used. It is expected that this material will enormously modify the post ultimate behaviour and thus contributes in increasing the energy absorption capacity of structures.</p>

				<h3>Bond Characteristics Of GFRP Bars</h3>
				<div id="image_slider">
					<h1>Image slider</h1>
				</div>
				<p>One of the issues while using reinforced concrete is the deterioration of the steel bars due to corrosion which decreases the life of structure. This can be overcome by replacing steel bars with GFRP bars. The study on this area will mark a way to start the use of recycled aggregate in India which will reduce the quarrying on natural resources.  </p>

				<p>Nano particles have been applied in many fields to fabricate new materials with novel functions due to their unique physical and chemical properties. It is expected that Self Compacting Concrete (SCC) containing silica nanoparticles will have better mechanical properties compared with the SCC without nano-silica. An experimental investigation will be carried out to study and record the influence of nano-silica in SCC.</p>
